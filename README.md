# Astro Starter Kit

This project is my default starting point for Astro projects. It comes with:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [A fleshed-out prettier config](https://prettier.io/)
- [Open-Props](https://open-props.style/#typography)

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Using This Template

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Set the origin: `git remote set-url <new repo url>`
3. Set the upstream: `git remote add upstream git@github.com:joshatbond/astro-template.git`
4. Push to the new repo: `git push -u origin main`

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
